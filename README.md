# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

A project implementing deep learning models for automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Overview

Brain tumors pose a serious health challenge, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and localizing brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning techniques. 

We are utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI scans and identify regions that indicate the presence of a tumor. This tool could potentially assist radiologists in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.

## Key Features

*   **Tumor Detection:** Identify whether a brain tumor is present in an MRI scan.
*   **Tumor Localization:** Generate bounding boxes or segmentations of tumor regions in the image.
*   **Model Support:**  Implements popular deep learning architectures like [Mention specific model names, e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, U-Net].
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Includes routines for standardizing and preparing MRI images for model input.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses common evaluation metrics such as [Mention specific metrics, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, dice score].
*   **Model Training Pipeline**: Easy way to start training model on different datasets.
*  **Jupyter Notebook Examples:** Includes example notebooks, to show how to perform certain tasks.

           image1.jpg
           image2.png
           ...
         no_tumor/
           image1.jpg
           image2.png
           ...
       val/
         tumor/
           ...
         no_tumor/
           ...
